        <h1>FAQ's</h1>
        <p>
     <p>Q. How will this Challenge help me ?</p>
    <p>A. Writing a blog after reading it will give you a better understanding of the chapter. When you explain to someone what you learn you understand it better this is just like the Feynman technique. Besides the other benefits would be better communication skills, more blogs will look very attractive on your portfolio as well when a recruiter goes through it.</p>
<br>
     <p>Q. Where can i put my blogs?</p>
     <p>A. You can host your blogs on sites like Hashnode, dev.to, and medium. You can also host it anywhere else. </p>
<br>
<p>Q. Where can i get the Book?</p>
     <p>A. Check the 2nd link on the navbar above for the link to the book. </p>
